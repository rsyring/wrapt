Changes
=======

Version 1.1.0
-------------

**New Features**

* Added a synchronized decorator for performing thread mutex locking on
  functions, object instances or classes. This is the same decorator as
  covered as an example in the wrapt documentation.

* Added a WeakFunctionProxy class which can wrap references to instance
  methods as well as normal functions.

* Exposed from the C extension the classes _FunctionWrapperBase,
  _BoundFunctionWrapper and _BoundMethodWrapper so that it is possible to
  create new variants of FunctionWrapper in pure Python code.

**Bugs Fixed**

* When deriving from ObjectProxy, and the C extension variant of **wrapt**
  was being used, if a derived class overrode __new__() and tried to access
  attributes of the ObjectProxy created using the base class __new__()
  before __init__() was called, then an exception would be raised
  indicating that the 'wrapper has not been initialised'.

* When deriving from ObjectProxy, and the C extension variant of **wrapt**
  was being used, if a derived class __init__() attempted to update
  attributes, even the special '_self_' attributed before calling the base
  class __init__() methid, then an exception would be raised indicating
  that the 'wrapper has not been initialised'.
